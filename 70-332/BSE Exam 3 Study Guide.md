# Employment Law and Workplace Regulation Study Notes
## 1. Worker Classification
### Dominant Test  
- **Concept:** The degree of control an employer has over a worker is a key factor in classification. If an employer can determine *how* and *when* work is performed, the worker is generally classified as an employee.
### Advantages to Businesses for Using Independent Contractors  
1. **Regulatory Relief:** Not subject to the same extensive labor and employment law standards as employees.
2. **Unemployment Insurance:** Employers are not required to provide unemployment benefits.
3. **Overtime Obligations:** No requirement to pay overtime.
4. **Tax Responsibilities:** No payroll tax obligations (e.g., withholding income tax).
### ABC Test (Typically Applied in California)  
A worker is presumed to be an **employee** unless all three criteria are met:
- **A:** The worker is free from the control and direction of the hiring entity in performing the work (as per the contract and in fact).
- **B:** The work is outside the usual course of the hiring entity’s business.
- **C:** The worker is customarily engaged in an independently established trade, occupation, or business of the same nature.
### Proposition 22 (California, 2020)  
Allows gig companies (e.g., Uber, Lyft) to classify drivers as independent contractors. It grants limited benefits without full employee rights.
### DOL Rules and Shifts in Overtime Thresholds  
- **Trump-Era:** Rolled back Obama’s proposed overtime rule raising the threshold to ~$47K, and set a lower threshold at about $35,568 per year.
- **Obama-Era Proposal:** Intended to raise the threshold from ~$23,660 to ~$47,476, which would have covered an extra 4 million workers; halted by a federal court.
## 2. Employment Terms and Conditions
### Employment Terms  
Most terms are not written but understood to be in good faith and reasonable. Employment is generally “at will” (either party can terminate) except where exceptions apply.
### Restrictive Covenants  
Used to protect trade secrets and proprietary information.  
- **Notes:** Disabilities are not an excuse to waive trade secret protection. California prohibits non-compete agreements (NCAs). The FTC has proposed eliminating NCAs, though legislation has not passed.
### Arbitration Agreements  
New employees often must sign agreements to resolve disputes via arbitration—a process that is typically less adversarial, quicker, and cheaper than litigation. Claims regarding harassment and sexual misconduct may still be litigated.
### Firing and Employment References  
Under at-will employment, firing is generally allowed unless it is discriminatory or violates contractual/public policy exceptions.  
- **Qualified Privilege:** Employers are protected when providing truthful, good faith employment references.
## 3. Wage, Hour, and Overtime Laws
### Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA)  
Establishes guidelines for child labor, minimum wage, and overtime.
### Minimum Wage  
- **Federal Minimum Wage:** $7.25/hour.  
- Some states consider higher minimums to address rising costs; discussions have mentioned increases (e.g., to $15/hour).
### Overtime  
- Workers must be paid 1.5 times their regular rate for over 40 hours/week.
- Exemptions exist for certain white-collar positions and those exceeding salary thresholds.
- Regulatory changes have led to variations in overtime eligibility between administrations.
## 4. Employee Benefits and Assistance Programs
### Health Insurance and the ACA  
Employers with 50+ full-time employees must provide affordable health insurance or face penalties; smaller employers may receive tax credits.
### COBRA  
Employers with 20+ employees must offer continued health benefits for up to 18 months after employment ends (except in misconduct cases).
### Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA)  
Eligible employees (at firms with 50+ employees) can take up to 12 weeks of unpaid, job-protected leave for qualifying reasons, often using PTO to maintain income.
### Unemployment Compensation  
Established under the 1935 Social Security Act. Eligibility requires meeting income thresholds and active job searching; independent contractors are ineligible. Typically, benefits last up to 26 weeks (40–60% of prior earnings). The CARES Act provided an extra $600/week temporarily (ended September 2021).
### WARN Act  
Applies to companies with 100+ employees. Employers must give 60 days' notice for layoffs affecting at least one-third of the workforce at sites with 150+ employees, reduction of 500+ employees, or site closures affecting 50+ employees. Exceptions exist for unforeseeable business circumstances.
## 5. Retirement and Pension Plans
### Defined-Benefit vs. Defined-Contribution Plans  
- **Defined-Benefit:** Provides fixed monthly payments funded by the employer.
- **Defined-Contribution:** Often involves employer matching (e.g., 401(k)); retirement benefits depend on investment performance.
### ERISA & PBGC  
- **ERISA:** (1974) Sets standards ensuring proper funding, transparency, and protection of employees’ benefits.
- **PBGC:** Insures defined-benefit plans and intervenes when an employer fails to meet obligations.
## 6. Drug Testing and Workplace Substance Policies
### Drug Testing Regulations  
Testing may occur in the following scenarios:  
1. Pre-employment  
2. Periodic testing (with notice, especially in safety-sensitive roles)  
3. For-cause testing (reasonable suspicion)  
4. Post-accident  
5. Follow-up after rehabilitation  
- **Legal Framework:** The Drug-Free Workplace Act of 1988 applies to employers with significant federal contracts/aids. Title VII requires non-discriminatory testing. The ADA protects recovering addicts (not active users).
## 7. Privacy, Monitoring, and Social Media in the Workplace
### Workplace Privacy  
Employers may monitor attendance, performance, email, and internet usage as part of routine business operations. The Electronic Communications Privacy Act (1986) regulates interception of electronic communications, with specific business exceptions.
### Social Media Protections  
About 25 states forbid employers from requesting employees’ social media credentials. Employers should avoid inquiring about personal information like age or marital status.
### Case Examples  
- **City of Ontario v. Quon (2010):** Approved review of work-issued pager messages for work-related purposes.  
- **Stengart v. Loving Care Agency (2010):** Protected personal emails on a work device under attorney-client privilege.  
- **Pietrylo v. Hillstone (2009):** Held managers liable for invading employee privacy by accessing a private MySpace group.
## 8. Employment Discrimination and Equal Opportunity
### Title VII and Other Federal Laws  
- **Title VII:** Prohibits discrimination based on race, color, religion, sex (including gender identity/sexual orientation), and national origin for employers with 15+ employees.
- **Related Laws:**  
  - Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA)  
  - Age Discrimination in Employment Act (ADEA)  
  - Equal Pay Act (1963)  
  - Civil Rights Act (1991): Expands remedies for discrimination, including compensatory and punitive damages.
### Disparate Treatment vs. Disparate Impact  
- **Disparate Treatment:** Intentional discrimination based on a protected characteristic.
- **Disparate Impact:** Neutral policies that disproportionately affect a protected group; employers must justify such policies with business necessity.
### Sexual Harassment and Discrimination  
- **Definitions:** Includes quid pro quo situations and hostile work environments.
- **Bona Fide Occupational Qualification (BFOQ):** Limited exception allowing some discrimination in essential job functions.
- **Protection Measures:**  
  - Pregnancy Discrimination Act (1978) treats pregnancy-related conditions as temporary disabilities.
  - Retaliation is prohibited for employees opposing discriminatory practices or filing complaints.
### Affirmative Action / DEI  
Higher education cases (e.g., Students for Fair Admissions lawsuits against Harvard and UNC-Chapel Hill) have challenged race-based admissions policies. In the June 29, 2023 Supreme Court decisions, both universities were ruled against, effectively ending affirmative action in admissions. Schools can consider applicants’ experiences and overcoming adversity but not race directly.
### Additional Anti-Discrimination Topics  
- **National Origin & Language Policies:** English-only rules must be narrowly applied and justified.
- **Retaliation:** Employees must show a causal link between protected activity (e.g., whistleblowing) and adverse employment action.
## 9. Immigration and Employment
### Key Definitions and Concepts  
- **Immigrant vs. Naturalized Citizen:** Immigrants are born outside the U.S.; naturalized citizens are not classified as immigrants.
- Immigrants comprise approximately 17–19% of the U.S. workforce, while illegal immigrants are less than 5%.
### Visa Programs and Employment  
- **H-1B Visa:**  
  - For temporary employment in specialty occupations (e.g., IT, engineering).  
  - Requirements include a bachelor’s degree (or equivalent) and an approved Labor Condition Application.  
  - Cap: 65,000 regular visas plus 20,000 for U.S. master’s degree holders; selection by lottery if needed.
- **H-2B Visa:**  
  - For temporary non-agricultural jobs (e.g., hospitality, landscaping).  
  - Employers must prove insufficient qualified U.S. workers are available.  
  - Cap: Approximately 66,000 annually.
- **1986 IRCA:**  
  Regulates the employment of illegal immigrants. Employers must verify employee identity and work eligibility (Form I-9; E-Verify for some).
### Enforcement and Privacy Concerns  
- **E-Verify:** An online system for work eligibility verification that has raised privacy concerns and risks of identity theft.
- **Government Oversight:** Agencies like ICE and USCIS enforce immigration laws and work authorization.
## 10. Labor and Union Law
### Historical Overview and Major Acts  
- **Labor Movements:** Emerged from urbanization in the 1880s with organizations like the Knights of Labor, AFL, and CIO (later merged).  
- **Key Legislation:**  
  - Wagner Act (NLRA, 1935): Grants rights to organize, form unions, and engage in collective bargaining; established the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB).  
  - Taft-Hartley Act (1947): Limits union activities and protects employers from unfair union practices.  
  - Landrum-Griffin Act (1959): Protects union members from corrupt practices and requires financial transparency.
### National Labor Relations Act (NLRA)  
Protects concerted activities (e.g., strikes, collective bargaining) and outlines unfair labor practices, including interference with employee rights, dominating union formation, or retaliatory actions.
### EEOC vs. NLRB: Similarities and Differences  
| **Feature**       | **EEOC**                                                        | **NLRB**                                                                    |
| ----------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Primary Focus** | Enforcing anti-discrimination laws (Title VII, ADA, ADEA, etc.) | Protecting labor rights and ensuring collective bargaining (NLRA)           |
| **Coverage**      | Employers with 15+ employees                                    | Mostly private sector employees (excluding government and some contractors) |
| **Process**       | Complaint investigation, mediation, and potential litigation    | Investigation of unfair labor practices, hearings, and complaint resolution |
| **Enforcement**   | Remedies like policy changes, reinstatement, back pay           | Remedies include ordering corrective actions and certifying union elections |
### Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR)  
Includes mediation, arbitration, and negotiation. ADR methods are favored for efficiency and reduced costs; arbitration is upheld as legally binding by the Supreme Court.
## 11. Notable Cases and Examples
### Higher Education and Affirmative Action  
- **Students for Fair Admissions Lawsuits:**  
  - **Against Harvard and UNC-Chapel Hill:** Alleged discrimination in admissions based on race (disadvantaging Asian American, white, or other applicants).  
  - **Supreme Court Decision (June 29, 2023):** Harvard (6-3) and UNC (6-2) were ruled against; race-conscious admissions deemed unconstitutional.
